Probably later
The particles around the black hole aren't forming a spiral. This is probably because they are not interacting with each other
    Need to come up with a fast way for the particles to also exert gravity on each other. 
    Distance calculation would probably be the slowest thing    
Photon emission:
    Emit photons from each particle
        N Photons in random directions 
        X Photons added to the particle system 
        Photons collide with the viewing plane, set a permanent particle there
        Make all other particles invisible
        Make units consistent
Optimization:
    Only a snapshot of the black hole can be obtained by simulating nothing else but photons
    The speed of the simulation would have to be slowed down
Investigate:
    Simulation is unstable when particles get too close to the black hole. Why? If its just acceleration, a 2nd order method should suffice?

Velocity generation of particles. The velocities must be generated tangential to the position of the particles (w.r.t  to the blackhole)
