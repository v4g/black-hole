Probably later
The particles around the black hole aren't forming a spiral. This is probably because they are not interacting with each other
    Need to come up with a fast way for the particles to also exert gravity on each other. 
    Distance calculation would probably be the slowest thing    
Photon emission:
    Emit photons from each particle
        N Photons in random directions 
        X Photons added to the particle system 
        Photons collide with the viewing plane, set a permanent particle there
        Make all other particles invisible
        Make units consistent
